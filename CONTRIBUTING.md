# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions of any size are welcome. These could be suggestions, issues, bug fixes, documentation updates, or new features.

Please follow the guidelines below to make the contribution process as smooth as possible.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository, then clone your fork to a local folder.

2. Create a local branch for your work.
   - Example: `git checkout -b feature/add-cool-function`

3. Make your changes on your branch.

4. Push your branch to your fork.

5. Open a pull request against `master` of the original repo.
   - All PRs must go through review before merging.
   - Only squash merging is allowed to help keep history clean.

6. Fill out the PR template (description, type of change, checklist, related issues).

7. Follow conventional commits naming for the final squash merge into `master`:
   - Format: `<type>: <description>`
   - Types used:
     - `feat:` a new feature
     - `fix:` a bug fix
     - `docs:` documentation only changes
     - `style:` formatting, whitespace, etc.
     - `refactor:` code changes that are not features or fixes
     - `test:` adding or fixing tests
     - `chore:` maintenance, build scripts, etc.
   - Example: `feat: add new feature`


## Code of conduct

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Provide helpful feedback, not just criticism.
- Remember that everyone starts somewhere. Be patient with new contributors.

## Additional notes

- For issues: please check if the problem or feature already exists.
- Contributions via issues, discussions, or PRs are all welcome.
- Thank you for helping improve the project! ❤️
